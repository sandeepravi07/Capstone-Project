Finding the best place in Newyork to Open a Restaurant

Introduction/Business Problem:

My idea will be every city has a lot of restaurants, but still there is always scope for new ones. Setting up a new restaurant requires a lot of capital investment upfront. So it is important that all measures are taken to ensure that a restaurant is a success. One of the important factors that determine the success of a restaurant is it's location along with the quality of service and food serviced in it. The location chosen for a new restaurant should primarily meet the below criteria. A location that has more number of restaurants as that implies a good demand for restaurants. A location that has no strong incumbent player or very little competition. A location that is in close proximity of affluent neighborhoods. This project aims to analyze the neighborhoods of Manhattan and Brooklyn to find a location that is most suitable to start a new Asian cuisine restaurant.

Data Collection-

We'll collect the required data from "https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/fbpwbovar7lf8p5sgddm06cgipa2rxpe.json".

The above json files gives the details in & around NY. Now we'll convert the Json data to Pandas Dataframe.
Using the geopy library we can acquire the Latitude & longitude of the location & convert the same into a data frame.
Once we have the dataframe ready with the Latitude & longitude of the specific location we can use the Fourasquare API to locate & analye the location to find the best place to open our restaurant.
