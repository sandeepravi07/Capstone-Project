Well there are many factors to be considered to open a small or big level business. For example say Mr Paul wants to open a Indian restaurant, first and foremost important point to decide is the location for his new restaurant. \n\n### Questions/Business Problems: \n\n1) On what basis can Paul decide his restaurant's location? \n\n2) Does Paul want to rent the place or can he afford to buy it? \n\n3) While selecting the place there are key points to consider like he needs to check out how many Indian restaurants are there in that specific location? If in-case there are already two Indian restaurants which have good ratings, will it be risky to open new one near these restaurants? \n\n4) What all factors will help Paul to run his business above average? \n\n",

            "source": "## Discussion:-\n\nLet's discuss the above mentioned Questions/ Business Problems. Firstly Paul needs to choose a suitable location for his restaurant. Let's say Paul wants to open a new Indian Restaurant in San Francisco. San Francisco is a famous tourist place, and also its in silicon valley, because of that real estate is very costly. So assuming that Paul wants to rent a place for his new restaurant. And now he needs to figure out how many restaurants are there in the neighborhood. If there are more than two Indian restaurants in a neighborhood then that would be a great risk to open new restaurant of same cuisine in that neighborhood. \n\nChoosing a place where there is less or no restaurant would be of great choice, considering the rent of neighborhood too. Why I'm emphasing that there should be less restaurants is, so that Paul will face less competition with same cuisine restaurants. He needs to look for a place where many people frequently visit so that his business is above average. \n\nPlaces like Downtown, Movie theatre, Malls & Gas stations would help his business running. Restaurants ratings, checking of customers might help in deciding location crowd. I would also suggest that Paul should check for opening and closing timings of othis restaurants. He may try opening his place 30 mins before other restaurants open up and close 30 mins or 1 hour later than other restaurants, this might help to get more customers.\n\n",

The restaurant details can be retrieved using search endpoint of foursquare location. \n\nFor our project we need only Indian restaurant data, and in search endpoint there is a attribute called category id, i.e for each category(like Indian or Italian or Mexican Restaurant) foursquare has a defined categoryid which will help us to get the desired data. In this search response, we'll retrieve the venue id of all the Indian venues. And then pass this venue id's through venue_id endpoint to get rating of each Indian restaurant. Let's save the data in a dataframe, for further testing.\n\nNow we need to select a neighborhood in which we have to reduce the competition for our new restaurant, hence we should test with only good rating restaurants.
